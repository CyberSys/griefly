Griefly roadmap
================
### Atmos
1. Small stmos units (**done**)
2. Big atmos grid (**partly done**)
3. Pipes system (**partly done**)
4. Fire system

### Movement system
1. Simple movement, passable levels, bumps (**done**)
2. Energy based movement system with friction and momentum (**partly done**)
3. Collision system, especially projectiles

### Network
1. Basic network with fat client (**done**)
2. Thin BYOND-like client
3. Some movement prediction on client

### Electricity
1. Wires with true resistance and bandwidth
2. Atmos based turbine as energy source
3. Inductivity and capacity
